  Good morning, starshine! The earth says hello!
</p>

<p>
  Today, I decided to start taking coding for my portfolio seriously and got on with learning HTML and CSS languages. And, completed the first part with HTML basics - with exercise done. Also, got to know that we would possibly be going to Dehradun for our GNMI project as the NGO is located there.
